    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    height: auto; /* Allow height to adjust to content */
    padding-bottom: 5rem; /* Add some space at the bottom */

  /*
     If your original style.css had any specific styles for a '.project-btn'
     that were UNIQUE to this Projects section (and not covered by the general
     .btn, .btn-color-1, .btn-color-2 rules already extracted), you would
     include them here. Otherwise, the existing button styles will apply.
  
     Example (if needed, otherwise omit):
     .project-btn {
       border-radius: 0.5rem; // Example, only if unique for project buttons
       font-size: 0.9em;
     }
